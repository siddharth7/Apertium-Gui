# Apertium-Gui
This a basic Gui that I have developed for apertium, as of now it doesn't translates any language.
This app just converts the text written in box and outputs the same data on the ouptut window in real time.
Just select language pair, and start typing(prerequisite: start the apertium - apy on localhost)
currently only en-eo(english-esparanto) translation is working

To run this,
1.keep all the file in a single folder
2.You need to have PyQt4 installed and a python compiler.
3.In the command line type:  python backendapertiummbasic.py

As of now you need PyQt libraries to run this, but a executable can also be build, which i would be doing in a laterstage(it will not require PyQt libraries)
