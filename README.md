# Apertium-Gui

This app just converts the text written in box and outputs the same data on the ouptut window in real time.
Language pairs that are locally available are working.

just run bashscript.sh

As of now you need PyQt libraries to run this, but a executable can also be build, which i would be doing in a laterstage(it will not require PyQt libraries)
