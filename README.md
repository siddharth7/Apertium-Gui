This app just converts the text written in box and outputs the same data on the ouptut window in real time.
Language pairs that are locally available on your system are working.

1. Functional Gui
2. Translates as you type
3. Manages start and stop of apertium-apy server

Usage:
open terminal
go to folder where these files are saved
chmod +x bashscript.sh
. bashcript.sh

As of now you need PyQt libraries to run this, but a executable can also be build, which i would be doing in a laterstage(it will not require PyQt libraries)
